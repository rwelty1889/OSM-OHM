# OSM-OHM
leaflet widget to overlay selected ways/relations from OSM and OHM on
embedded map. default is race tracks, but the tags can be overridden if
needed.

Needs to be updated to current leaflet, but there is an issue with L. no
longer being current and some of the leaflet plugins used are no longer
being maintained.

Watkins.html contain a usage example. You need to supply your own
mapbox key to use mapbox images.
